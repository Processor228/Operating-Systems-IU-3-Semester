The results of execution depend on quantum size:

size = 2:
Average results for this run:
        avg_wt=9.857142
        avg_tat=14.142858

size = 4:
Average results for this run:
        avg_wt=9.142858
        avg_tat=13.428572

size = 6:
Average results for this run:
        avg_wt=9.142858
        avg_tat=13.428572

size = 10:
Average results for this run:
        avg_wt=8.000000
        avg_tat=12.285714

We may come to conclusion that even if RR algorithm distributes CPU time fairly between processes,
average measurements do not exceed the previous two algorithms on the provided data.txt.

But, response time dropped on most of the processes.
