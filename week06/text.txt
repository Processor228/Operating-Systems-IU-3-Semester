I’m pretty much screwed.
That’s my considered opinion.
Screwed.
Six days in to what should be a greatest two months of my life, and
it’s turned in to a nightmare.
I don’t even know who’ll read this. I guess someone will find it
eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now.
For the record… I didn’t die on Sol 6. Certainly the rest of the crew
thought I did, and I can’t blame them. Maybe there’ll be a day of national
mourning for me, and my Wikipedia page will say “Mark Watney is the
only human being to have died on Mars.”
And it’ll be right, probably. Cause I’ll surely die here. Just not on Sol
6 when everyone thinks I did.
Let’s see… where do I begin?
The Ares program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to
another planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of
humanity blah, blah, blah. The Ares 1 crew did their thing and came back
heroes. They got the parades and fame and love of the world.
Ares 2 did the same thing, in a different location on Mars. They got a
firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee when they got home.
Ares 3. Well. That was my mission. Well, not mine per se.
Commander Lewis was in charge. I was just one of her crew. Actually, I
was the very lowest ranked member of the crew. I would only be “in
command” of the mission if I were the only remaining person.
What do you know? I’m in command.
I wonder if this log will be recovered before the rest of the crew die of
old age? I presume they got back to Earth all right. Well, guys, if you’re
reading this: It wasn’t your fault. You did what you had to do. In your
position I would have done the same thing. I don’t blame you,
and I’m glad you survived.
