As per measurements,
1 test:
Real time approximately equal to user time, since the system is one-threaded.
2 test:
Real time starts decreasing, and user time grows, it becomes even greater than actual time,
since this only measures overall cpu time (and my computer has more than one core).
3-5 tests:
Same situations, user time demonstrates growth (also, I suppose due to the
reason that thread-management also takes some time), and real time
decays.
