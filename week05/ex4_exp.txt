1)
On single threaded process, real time is approximately equal to user time.
There is no additional scheduling between threads needed

2)
When 2 threads deal with this problem, real time dropped to almost twice
smaller than it was.

3)
When even more threads appear, time tends to almost 2 seconds, and
sys time increases, since there is more time needed to await for blocked mutexes.
