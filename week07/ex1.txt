On queries.txt, presented in the lab, First-Fit outperforms all other
algorithms significantly:

    FF:
0.615370
Throughput: 89.377123 op/sec

    BF:
2.054725
Throughput: 26.767572 op/sec

    WF:
1.784218
Throughput: 30.825830 op/sec

And BF, WF perform approximately in the same way.
This is merely because FF doesn't iterate through all the 10^7 cells.
