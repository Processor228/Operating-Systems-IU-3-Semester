On queries.txt, presented in the lab, First-Fit outperforms all other
algorithms significantly:

    FF:
5.580570
Throughput: 9.855624 op/sec

    BF:
16.983258
Throughput: 3.238483 op/sec

    WF:
15.596878
Throughput: 3.526347 op/sec

And BF, WF perform approximately in the same way.
This is merely because FF doesn't iterate through all the 10^7 cells.
