On the data provided in the gist, the hit ratio tends to (frames/pages), for all the algorithms
frames = 50, pages = 1000 Hit ratio: 0.043956
frames = 100, pages = 1000 Hit ratio: 0.102897
frames = 250, pages = 1000 Hit ratio: 0.226773

However, when # of frames increases, like > 500, hit ratio stays at 0.36-0.37.5
frames = 500 : 0.36
frames = 700 : 0.374
frames = 800 : 0.374
