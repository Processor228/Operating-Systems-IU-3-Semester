In my implementation of TLB, it is also checked whether the page was evicted from the frame
in the future, so using TLB we really can say that a page is in RAM. But, if it is not,
I count it as a TLB miss.

TLB miss ratio tends to paging miss ratio (In ideal). But, of course, it's size is too
limited, and it's efficiency won't reach it.
On data provided from gist, pages = 1000, and frames = 200:
Hit ratio: 0.188811
TLB miss ratio: 0.850150

Additionally, the lesser frames, the more TLB miss rate, since the number of translations grows,
and it can't store that much data.
Same data, pages = 1000, but frames = 100:
Hit ratio: 0.102897
TLB miss ratio: 0.876124
