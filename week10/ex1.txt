1) If we try to modify myfile11.txt, the monitor.c will detect it with messages
"File myfile11.txt acessed",
"File myfile11.txt modified",

because this event is triggered for both directory that we watch and the file.

2) When we create a symbolic link myfile13.txt the watched directory got
IN_CREATE event, this caused the following message to appear:
"New file myfile13.txt created".
Then, we modify the file /tmp/myfile1.txt and no changes been registered
by the watched directory.

This happened because this event was triggered for /tmp directory, not
./path that monitor watches, though both files point to the same inode.

3) In the end, we got 2 as the number of links to the myfile11.txt, which is logical,
since there is also file /tmp/myfile1.txt which points to the same data.
